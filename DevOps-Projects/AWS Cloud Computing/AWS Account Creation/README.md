### **3. Background Concepts**

#### **3.1 What is Cloud Computing?**

Cloud computing is like a virtual storage and computing environment accessible via the internet. Instead of storing files, photos, and applications locally, they are kept securely on powerful, remote servers and accessed as needed.
It works like a “magical backpack” that can be accessed from anywhere with an internet connection.

#### **3.2 What is AWS Cloud?**

AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a leading cloud provider offering services like computing power, storage, databases, networking, and more — all available over the internet. It enables businesses and individuals to access enterprise-level infrastructure without owning physical hardware.

#### **3.3 Importance of AWS Cloud**

AWS Cloud allows even small startups to compete with larger enterprises by offering:

* **Pay-as-you-go pricing model** — pay only for what you use.
* **Scalability** — easily adjust resources based on demand.
* **Cost-effectiveness** — no large upfront hardware investment.
