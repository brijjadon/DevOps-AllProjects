# Welcome to My DevOps Projects 🚀

Hello and welcome!  
This repository is a collection of **hands-on DevOps projects** I’ve worked on to explore, practice, and demonstrate skills in **automation, CI/CD, cloud infrastructure, and containerization**.  

## 📌 What You’ll Find Here
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** with Terraform, Ansible, etc.
- **CI/CD pipelines** using Jenkins, GitHub Actions.
- **Containerization & orchestration** with Docker and Kubernetes.
- **Cloud integrations** (AWS, Azure, GCP).
- **Monitoring & logging** solutions with Prometheus, Grafana, ELK.

## 🎯 Purpose
- To **learn and practice** modern DevOps tools and workflows.
- To **showcase** my ability to design, automate, and manage scalable infrastructure.

Feel free to explore, fork, and adapt the projects for your own learning.
